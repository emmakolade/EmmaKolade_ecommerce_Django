# EmmaKolade Ecommerce Website

This is an Ecommerce store that allows customers to shop for different wears 
and choose the option to either sign up or purchase goods without signing up and make payment with their 
paypal account or choose the option to pay with their card.
This is a very personal project, I once had a business named EmmaKolade, that deals with 
selling authentic handmade leather slippers.

## Features

User Authentication and Authorisation: Users can easily create an account on the website, they can also decide not to create an account and go on with business.
Users can also signup with their  Google, Facebook and Twitter accounts.
